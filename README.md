## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to get a better understanding of how mental health is effecting employees in the tech industry. I worked on this dataset as part of my IU studies and hoped to find some interesting insights and also changes that tech companies could take towards this matter.

## Project Description
The data is sourced on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-2016). In the first stages of the project the high dimensionality und un-uniformity of answers was the biggest challenge. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing was definetly the most time-consuming part of this project. (Also one of the reasons why I picked this dataset).

## Getting Started
